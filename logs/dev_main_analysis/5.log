  📋 identify_column_values 节点 (深度: 1):
    父动作: IdentifyColumnValuesAction
    识别列值: To answer the question, you need to use the following column values from the `worldcities` table:

- `city`: To get the names of the cities.
- `lat`: To determine the latitude of each city, which helps in identifying whether a city is in the southern or western hemisphere.
- `population`: To find the population of each city.

The SQL query would involve filtering cities based on their latitude (south of 0 for the southern hemisphere and west of 0 for the western hemisphere), grouping them, and then ordering by population in descending order to find the city with the highest population in both hemispheres.
