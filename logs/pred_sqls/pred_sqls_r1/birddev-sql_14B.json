    "<think>\nTo answer this question, we need to generate a SQL query that will return the number of districts where the average salary of females is more than 6000 but less than 10000. Let's break down the steps to derive the query:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant tables**: We need the `district` table for the average salary (`A11`) and the `client` table for the gender information. Additionally, we need the `disp` table to connect clients to districts since the `client` table does not directly reference the `district` table.\n\n2. **Join the tables**: We need to join the `district` table with the `disp` table on the `district_id` field, and then join the `disp` table with the `client` table on the `client_id` field. This will allow us to access the average salary (`A11`) for each client and their gender.\n\n3. **Filter by gender**: We need to filter the results to only include female clients, which can be done by adding a `WHERE` clause with the condition `client.gender = 'F'`.\n\n4. **Filter by average salary**: We need to filter the results to only include districts where the average salary is more than 6000 but less than 10000. This can be done by adding a `HAVING` clause with the condition `A11 > 6000 AND A11 < 10000`.\n\n5. **Count the number of districts**: Finally, we need to count the number of districts that meet the conditions. This can be done by using the `COUNT` function on the `district_id` field.\n\n6. **Write the SQL query**: Putting it all together, the SQL query should be\n</think>\n<answer>",
